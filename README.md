## Random Password Generator

Our assignment was to create a random password generator by using what we've learned about Javascript. Including arrays and functions as well as object methods. 

Our password generator will generate a random password with any number of characters between 8 and 128. Through a series of prompts the user has to opportunity to choose the number of characters, whether it should include capital letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or symbols. 

Noting that this project is being submitted but it is not complete. I found it challenging to finish and plan to continue to work on it. I appreciate any helpful feedback. Here is the live link for what I've done so far:
